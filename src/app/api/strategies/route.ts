const MARKOV_RESEARCH = `## Markov Regime Model — SPY / QQQ / DIA

### What the model actually does

The \`markov-hedge-fund-method\` skill (installed at \`~/.claude/skills/markov-hedge-fund-method/\`) fits a **3-state discrete Markov chain** to daily price history. Here's the pipeline step by step:

1. **Fetch daily OHLCV** from Yahoo Finance (default: 5 years)
2. **Label each day** as Bull / Sideways / Bear using a 20-day rolling return window
3. **Estimate a 3×3 transition matrix** — each cell is the probability of moving from regime X tomorrow given you're in regime X today
4. **Solve the stationary distribution** — the long-run % of time spent in each regime (eigenvector of the matrix)
5. **Walk-forward backtest** — re-estimates the matrix at every step with only past data (no lookahead). Outputs annualised Sharpe + max drawdown
6. **Optional HMM upgrade** — fits a Gaussian HMM via hmmlearn's Baum-Welch algorithm, giving mean daily return per latent state

### Key finding: regimes are real and sticky

The persistence diagonal is the important number. A 90% Bull→Bull persistence means **once you're in a Bull regime, there's a 90% chance you'll still be in it tomorrow**. Regimes don't flip randomly — they last weeks or months. That's what makes them tradeable.

The 3×3 transition matrices also show a structural feature: **Bull never transitions directly to Bear in one day** (0.00% for SPY and DIA). A trend day almost always passes through Sideways first. This means the model gives early warning before major drawdowns.

---

### Why DIA has negative walk-forward Sharpe

DIA allocates less time in Bull (39%) vs SPY/QQQ (~47–48%). More importantly, DIA's Sideways stationary weight is 38% vs 27% for QQQ — the Dow spends more time range-bound, which is hard to trade with a simple long/flat/short allocation rule. The DIA result is intentionally included here as a negative example — **not all tickers suit Markov allocation**.

---

### How the model is currently used in the bot

The trading bot does NOT use this Markov skill directly. It uses a simpler SMA50/200 + ATR detector in \`engine/regime_detector.py\`:
- SMA50 > SMA200 + ATR normal → BULL
- SMA50 < SMA200 or ATR spike → BEAR
- Otherwise → SIDEWAYS

This SMA-based detector gates the TQQQ ORB strategy — Bull days buy TQQQ, Bear days buy SQQQ, Sideways days sit flat.

---

### How to upgrade: replace SMA detector with Markov

The Markov model's walk-forward Sharpe of 0.26–0.60 on SPY/QQQ suggests the regimes have real predictive power. Three ways to wire it in:

**Option A — Drop-in gate replacement**
Replace \`detect_regime()\` in \`engine/regime_detector.py\` with a Markov posterior. Instead of SMA crossover, use the current-state probability vector. Higher confidence = bigger position.

**Option B — Composite vote**
Run the Markov model on SPY + QQQ simultaneously. Only trade TQQQ ORB when both agree on Bull, only trade SQQQ when both agree on Bear. Reduces trade frequency but improves conviction.

**Option C — Persistence-weighted sizing**
Use the Bull→Bull persistence as a position scaler. If Bull persistence is 92%, trade 40% of account. If it drops to 75% (regime becoming unstable), trade 25%. Scale with regime confidence.

---

### What to watch
- Rerun \`/markov SPY\` weekly to check if persistence diagonal is changing
- If Bull→Bull drops below 80%, the regime is weakening — consider reducing TQQQ ORB size
- A Bear stationary distribution rising above 35% is a regime-shift warning
- Compare the HMM's current state assignment to the SMA detector — disagreements are informative`;

const TQQQ_ORB_RESEARCH = `## Why TQQQ Opening Range Breakout

### Research session — 2026-05-23

#### Asset selection: equities over crypto
We ran Markov regime analysis on BTC-USD and ETH-USD (5yr, 20-day window):

| Asset | Walk-forward Sharpe | Max Drawdown | Bear % long-run |
|-------|--------------------:|-------------:|----------------:|
| BTC   | −0.15               | −70.3%       | 39%             |
| ETH   | −0.25               | −94.2%       | 46%             |

The naive Markov regime approach (long in Bull, flat otherwise) produces **negative walk-forward Sharpe on both**. The regimes ARE real and persistent (87% Bear↔Bear, 88% Bull↔Bull) but the 20-day labelling window creates too much lag on the entry/exit. Crypto was ruled out.

#### Instrument: TQQQ over margin or raw QQQ
- TQQQ (Direxion 3× QQQ) gives ~3× QQQ exposure with no margin calls and no interest charges
- For single-day holds the volatility decay that hurts TQQQ long-term holders is negligible
- Alpaca paper supports TQQQ as a regular equity — the bot just buys/sells it like any stock
- Chose 40% account allocation per trade → effective ~$120k QQQ exposure on a $100k account

#### Strategy: Opening Range Breakout
The first 15 minutes after open (9:30–9:44 ET) capture initial price discovery. A clean break above the range high or below the range low statistically continues in the breakout direction, especially when confirmed by the macro regime. Rules:

1. Wait for the 9:30–9:44 QQQ 1-min range to form
2. At 9:45 ET lock High and Low
3. Check SPY regime (SMA50/SMA200 + ATR):
   - **BULL** → only take upside breaks → buy TQQQ
   - **BEAR** → only take downside breaks → buy SQQQ (3× inverse)
   - **SIDEWAYS** → sit flat for the day
4. On breakout: enter via Alpaca bracket order (entry + TP + SL in one API call)
5. Force-flatten at 3:55 PM regardless

#### Parameter rationale
| Param | Value | Reasoning |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| ORB window | 15 min | Standard; longer windows reduce false breaks |
| Position size | 40% | Meaningful without betting the whole account on one signal |
| Trailing stop | 2% from peak | Rides winners with no upside cap; 2% gives room through TQQQ noise |
| Hard floor | −3% from entry | Absolute worst-case per trade; checked every 30s in the main loop |
| Flatten | 3:55 PM | No overnight risk; avoids thin end-of-day tape |
| Daily drawdown halt | 3% of SOD equity | Kill-switch if multiple bad ticks compound |

#### Exit strategy decision — trailing stop over fixed take-profit
Originally designed with a fixed +6% take-profit. Replaced with a 2% trailing stop after recognising that capping gains at +6% left significant money on the table on strong trend days (TQQQ can run +15–20% on a big macro move).

**How the two-layer exit works:**
1. **Trailing stop (Alpaca-native):** placed immediately after entry. Follows the price up tick by tick. Exits automatically when price pulls back 2% from the intraday high-water mark. No upside cap.
2. **Hard floor (bot-side):** main loop checks the instrument price every 30 seconds. If it drops to −3% from entry before the trailing stop has moved up at all, the bot cancels all orders and closes the position immediately. This handles gap-downs and flash crashes that could slip past the trail.

The 2% trail was chosen over tighter (1%) or looser (4%) options because TQQQ's typical intraday noise is ~1–1.5% on a trend day. A 1% trail would shake out frequently on normal volatility; 4% would give back too much profit on a reversal.

#### SPY regime as gate (not BTC's own regime)
The existing SPY Markov strategy has walk-forward Sharpe of 0.74–0.91. Using SPY's regime as the gate means we only day-trade TQQQ on days where macro conditions confirm the direction. This is the key alpha lever — a raw ORB without a regime filter has far more whipsaws.

#### What to watch / future improvements
- Backtest ORB on QQQ history with this exact regime gate to calibrate the parameters
- Consider a minimum range width filter (e.g. skip if range < 0.3% — too tight = false signals)
- VIX spike filter: if VIX > 30 at open, widen the trail to 3% or skip entirely
- Add a volume confirmation: breakout should have above-average volume on the breakout candle
- Consider tightening the trail to 1.5% once in profit by 5%+ (lock in more on big days)`;
