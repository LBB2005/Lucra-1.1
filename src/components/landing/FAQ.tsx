    q: "Is Lucra's data real, or is it making things up?",
    a: "Every figure in a Lucra briefing is pulled from a primary source — SEC EDGAR for financials and insider transactions, Finnhub for market data and earnings, and Perplexity for real-time news and sentiment. When Lucra can't verify a data point, it says so rather than guessing.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is Lucra giving me financial advice?",
    a: "No. Lucra is a research tool — it synthesises information and presents analysis, but every decision is yours to make. Think of it like having a very thorough analyst team: they give you the research, you decide what to do with it.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is this different from just asking ChatGPT about a stock?",
    a: "ChatGPT doesn't have access to real-time market data, SEC filings, or live financial figures. It also doesn't maintain context about your portfolio or investment style across sessions. Lucra is purpose-built for investment research: 15 domain-specific agents, real data sources, and a persistent memory of what you own and how you invest.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the hedge fund tab / Pro tier?",
    a: "Pro includes a dashboard that mirrors the structure of a hedge fund trading desk — live Alpaca paper trading, order management, automated strategy execution, and Markov regime detection. It's paper trading only to start — a way to test strategies systematically before putting real money behind them.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I import my existing portfolio?",
    a: "Yes. Lucra supports manual entry, CSV upload, and brokerage statement parsing. Once your holdings are in, every AI analysis is automatically contextualised to your actual positions.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens to my data?",
    a: "Your portfolio and conversation data is stored securely in Firebase and never sold to third parties. See our Privacy Policy for details.",
